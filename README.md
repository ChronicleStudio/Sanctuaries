Sanctuaries, a mod created and inspired by the Civ genre mod Bastions.

Sanctuaries aims to give the players the ability to prevent in game block placement and reinforcement within an area of effect. (AoE and some other features are configurable)
The Sanctuaries will consume food with saturation as a resource to fuel itself.
You can leave food within inventories within 7 blocks distance (configurable) and it will consume the food over time and store inside its "battery".

Whoever activates the Sanctuary along with any player that is in a group that the Sanctuary is reinforced by will be immune to the affects, except while "Under Siege".
While players who are unaligned (described above) with the Sanctuary are inside of the Sanctuaries AoE, the Sanctuary is considered "Under Siege" and additional conditions are added to the "Defenders". (Players aligned with the Sanctuary)
  Defenders while under siege and inside the AoE of the Sanctuary will also not be able to place blocks or reinforce blocks until all enemies are outside of the radius of the Sanctuary.
